      <h2>Some of my work</h2>
      <p>One of the more interesting projects I worked on was in an IPRO class where our team was
        tasked with finding a way to more cheaply produce hydrogen while maintaining low environmental impacts.
        My team and I designed a device that would efficiently produce electricity and heat in a
        single unit while reducing wasted energy and lower the carbon footprint usually caused. I
        not only enjoyed the design process but als the creation of a logo and overall brand for
        the product we designed.</p>
